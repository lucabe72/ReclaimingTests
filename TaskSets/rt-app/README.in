README for rt-app @VERSION@

==============
 INTRODUCTION
==============

rt-app is a test application that starts multiple periodic threads in order to 
simulate a real-time periodic load. It supports SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_FIFO, 
SCHED_RR as well as the AQuoSA framework and SCHED_DEADLINE.

Code is currently maintained on GitHub:

	https://github.com/gbagnoli/rt-app


==============
 REQUIREMENTS
==============

rt-app runs on GNU/Linux. It needs autoconf, automake, libtool and a recent
compiler (mainly: gcc) for basic features.

For advanced usage, the following optional libraries are needed:
- qreslib for AQuoSA support (and, obviously a GENS_SCHED patched kernel)
- a SCHED_DEADLINE patched kernel to support SCHED_DEADLINE policy.
- json-c installed for reading config files. In case libjson is not available
  for your target, you can download and compile json-c from
  http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/


=============
 COMPILATION
=============

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Last step is optional, rt-app is generated in the src/ directory.

Typical usage:
$ ./configure --with-aquosa
	adds support for the AQuoSA framework.
	qreslib MUST be installed in the system to compile this feature

$ ./configure --with-deadline
	adds support for SCHED_DEADLINE.
	There are no compile-time requirements for this feature.

$ ./configure --with-json
	adds support for reading taskset definitions from JSON files
	(and from stdin).
	json-c (libjson.so.0.0.1) is needed to compile this feature.

$ ./configure --prefix=<directory>
	installs the compiled program in  the given directory

see ./configure --help for additional options.

For cross-compilation, you may have to set the CC environment variable to your
cross-compiler, and provide the --host option (e.g., --host=arm).

=======
 USAGE
=======

$ rt-app <config_file>
where config file is a full/relative path to a json file (look under doc/ for
an example config file) or "-" (without quotes) to read JSON data from stdin.

OR you can use commandline to define the taskset.
Keep in mind that on commandline it will never be possible to define resources
and how tasks access them.

$ rt-app
usage: rt-app [options] -t <period>:<exec>[:cpu affinity[:policy[:deadline[:prio]]]] 

-h, --help	:	show this help
-f, --fifo	:	set default policy for threads to SCHED_FIFO
-r, --rr	:	set default policy fior threads to SCHED_RR
-s, --spacing	:	msec to wait beetween thread starts
-l, --logdir	:	save logs to different directory
-b, --baselog	:	basename for logs (implies -l . if not set)
-G, --gnuplot	:	generate gnuplot script (needs -l)
-D, --duration	:	time (in seconds) before stopping threads
-K, --no-mlock	:	Do not lock pages in memory
-q, --qos	:	create AQuoSA reservation
-g, --frag	:	fragment for the reservation

POLICY: f=SCHED_FIFO, r=SCHED_RR, o=SCHED_OTHER, q=AQuoSA
AFFINITY: comma-separated cpu index (starting from 0) i.e. 0,2,3 for first,
third and fourth CPU

Note: when using AQuoSA scheduling, priority is used as percent increment for
budget over exec time

Options:

* --fifo,--rr and --qos sets the default scheduling policy for all threads.
	--qos is available only when compiled with AQuoSA support enabled.

* --logdir and --baselog control log output (rt-app creates one log for each
	thread).  If --logdir is not present, rt-app logs everything to stdout.
	When logging to file and -D (see below) is present, the file is written
	at the end of execution, during which all logging data is kept in
	memory.

* --gnuplot if it is present then rt-app outputs sample gnuplot scripts to
	$logdir (which must be passed too

* --spacing and --duration control the spacing between threads and their
	duration of execution,  i.e. each thread is started every $spacing ms
	and the total runtime is $duration.

* --frag (AQuoSA only): fragments the reservation period by $fragmentation, i.e.
	reservation period is $frag times smaller than thread's period.

* --no-mlock: do not lock threads' memory pages when using realtime scheduling
	classes

Each thread is specified by

	--thread <period>:<exec>[:$POLICY[:deadline[:prio]]]:

period   : thread period in microseconds
exec     : thread WCET in microseconds
policy   : one of f=SCHED_FIFO, r=SCHED_RR, o=SCHED_OTHER, q=AQuoSA (if enabled)
affinity : comma-separated cpu index (starting from 0) i.e. 0,2,3 for first,
	   third and fourth CPU
prio     : thread priority in SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR/SCHED_OTHER, percentile
           increment for AQuoSA reservation budget w.r.t. WCET.
deadline : deadline in microseconds (used ONLY for plotting!)
